Experimental design

Ok, so here is the general plan.

I'm going to give a presentation. This presentation will be to a group
of at least 10 people, and I will give one at least six times. AAt
these presentations, I will have a stack of notecards, each of which
has different roles on them. These rolls will be

-paying full attention

-sorta paying attention

-stop paying attention sometime into the test

-pretending to pay attention but actally staring at your phone

-just playing computer games in class

There will be at least twice as many notecards as students, ensuring
that I don't know how many students are doing what, let alone who
is doing what.

I will record when, how accurately, and how long it takes the system
to tell me who is not paying attention. The main data, however, is
taken by the system. At the end of the course, a class question test
will be applied over the material. This questionare will test understanding,
as well as asking what role they had, and finally asking how well
they liked the system for my own personal use. This test will also
ask how well they understood the presentation, in addition to testing
that with the class questions.

This will produce several datasets that can be compard to rigorous
datapoints. First, I should be able to chart (Bar graph) how mutch
attention they were paying vs which role they had, which should tell
me how well I am doing. Yes, I am aware that some students told to
pay attention will in fact not pay attention. This will be accounted
for in the class question quiz.

Another provided data set will be how well the system thinks they
understand the material vs how well they think they understand the
material.

A third is when the computer tells me people arn't paying attention-
essentially, I want to see if I can catch the people who stop paying
attention part of they way through the presentation.
