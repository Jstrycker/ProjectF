Faraday documentation: Learning management 2.0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ok, gonna be real for a second.
 I've never used LATEX before.
 So the formatting on this is going to be rough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Design Purpose- create a learning management platform that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Facilitates student learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Assists professors in understanding both what their student's understand
 and how much they are paying attention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Too that end, record and analyze student data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Create a web based platform that can handle the display of multiple media
 types.
 This should use Hapi, Angular, and POSTGRESQUL

Database ERD

\begin_layout Standard
INSERT ERD HERE ONCE I FIND OUT HOW

Here is the general idea for how the site will flow

General Ideas-

What to record-

Was there typing?

Slide number vs prof slide number

\begin_layout Standard
Class question responses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Number of times they hit the help button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the page up?- was going to use onFocus and Blur events, but those are
 pretty finicky, so the page visibility stuff google made may be the way
 to go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that we don't want to work too hard on trying to catch
 people not paying attention- If they want to fake it to that degree, I'm
 not sue how much we can help them.
 Maybe make a captchca for every slide, IDK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These responses will be synthesied into how much they understood/paid attention
 to each subject covered in a day.
 In addition, the software should dprovide a fantastic way to take attendance,
 and should be able to inform the professor if a student is clearly not
 paying attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the long term, this software should keep track of attendance, class questions
, and even perhaps grades to be able to assess how much help students need
 in a class, and should appraise the professor of who needs help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would love to write a neural net or other machine learning algorhythm
 to decide this, but I bet we're looking for

- a sharp downturn in grades

\begin_layout Standard
- poor clicker performance
